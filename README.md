# hello-world

using GitHub to store my learning javascript progress from moz://a MDN web docs to get started.

using javascript for both client-side and server-side scripting and for use in maxMSP through the js and jsui objects.

while learning the basics from a web browser perspective with MDN web docs i am also learning how to use javascript in maxMSP

Javascript can be used with MSP objects and functions for audio applications

and with jitter tools for video. There are a lot more resources that people have contributed to the maxMSP environment, these 

will be experimented with, in order to use maxMSP in audio and AV apps that i will store on my website using my basic html and css skills

and especially with javascript. i will endevour to use any web design tools i come across so that my website content can be 

accessed and played with interactively as a first point of contact to my work as a sound artist, audio systems designer, electronics 

audio developer, AV technician and as an audio engineer, music producer and broadcast engineer and program maker.

These options for using javascript in max will also be saved in my GitHub hello-world repository.
